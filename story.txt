Once upon a time, there was a little girl who lived in a village near the forest.
Whenever she went out, the little girl wore a red riding cloak, so everyone in the village called her Little Red Riding Hood.
One morning, Little Red Riding Hood asked her mother if she could go to visit her grandmother since they hadn't meet each other for a long time.
"That's a good idea," her mother said.  So they packed a nice basket for Little Red Riding Hood to take to her grandmother.
"Remember, go straight to Grandma's house," her mother said."Don't dawdle along the way and please don't talk to strangers!  The woods are dangerous."
