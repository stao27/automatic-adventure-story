Once upon a time, there was a little girl who lived in a village near the forest.
Whenever she went out, the little girl wore a red riding cloak, so everyone in the village called her Little Red Riding Hood.
One morning, Little Red Riding Hood asked her mother if she could go to visit her grandmother since they hadn't meet each other for a long time.
"That's a good idea," her mother said.  So they packed a nice basket for Little Red Riding Hood to take to her grandmother.
"Remember, go straight to Grandma's house," her mother said."Don't dawdle along the way and please don't talk to strangers!  The woods are dangerous."

"Don't worry, mommy," said Little Red Riding Hood, "I'll be careful."
But when Little Red Riding Hood noticed some lovely flowers in the woods, she forgot her promise to her mother.  She picked a few, watched the butterflies flit about for awhile, listened to the frogs croaking and then picked a few more. 
Little Red Riding Hood was enjoying the warm summer day so much, that she didn't notice a dark shadow approaching out of the forest behind her...
Suddenly, the wolf appeared beside her.

"Hi,little girl."said the wolf."Where are you up to?"
â€œHi little puppy.I am going to vist my grandmother.Here is what I prepare for her."showed her basket."You must be a good pet.Come on."
"What the ..."thought by the wolf."I am pissed know.I will eat both of you.Let me eat your grandma first,then come to you."
"Sorry.I have many things to deal with.Goodbye."Wolf left with a smile.
On the other side of the wood,the outlaw Jesse McCree was training with his Peacekeeper.  

"Wake up, darling. It's nine thirty. You need to get up and go to see your grandma." Little Red Riding Hood's mommy said. Little Red Riding Hood realized that she was just in a dream. She went off the bed and had the breakfast after she brushed her teeth. "Goodbye, mom. I'll be back before dusk." Little Red Riding Hood said to her mom and left home.
